# Placeholder images for projects
# Replace these with your actual project images

This directory should contain your project images:
- Cover images for project cards
- Screenshots for project detail pages
- Gallery images

Recommended naming convention:
- `project-name-cover.jpg` - Main cover image
- `project-name-screenshot1.jpg` - Additional screenshots
- `project-name-screenshot2.jpg`

Image guidelines:
- Cover images: 800x600px or 16:9 aspect ratio
- Screenshots: Any resolution, but optimize for web
- File formats: JPG for photos, PNG for screenshots with text
- Optimize images before uploading to keep site fast
