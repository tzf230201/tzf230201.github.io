                <h3>Implementing Model Predictive Control (MPC) on Ackermann Drive Robot for Autonomous Vehicle Simulation on ROS Gazebo</h3>
                <p>
                    I've tried implementing Model Predictive Control (MPC) on a simulated Ackermann drive robot described in URDF (Universal Robot Description Format). This allows the robot to predict future states and adjust its path accordingly. Utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS), the robot navigates through dynamic environments using Gazebo for 3D simulation and RViz for visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The robot relies on a Lidar sensor to understand its surroundings, spotting obstacles and other simulation-vehicles . It also uses odometry through dead reckoning to know its exact location amidst the chaos.

                    Through this project, I aim to show that autonomous navigation in dynamic environments is achievable, obviously with keen perception, smart planning, and accurate modeling, I'm paving the way for a future where autonomous vehicles can navigate the world around them effortlessly.

                    KRI Cakra, a submarine of the 209/1300 type, was manufactured by Howaldtswerke in Kiel, Germany, in 1981. This type of submarine is widely utilized by navies around the world. The difficulty in sourcing spare parts for repairs poses a significant challenge. Therefore, it becomes essential to consider modernizing the submarine system.

                    Reverse engineering an old device with fully analog signals need to understanding its inner workings. documentation plays a crucial role in the reverse engineering process, especially for an old device with fully analog signals. Any documentation or technical specifications related to the device can provide valuable insights for us. We also utilizing tools like oscilloscopes to analyze signal characteristics, identifying electronic components, and tracing circuit paths on the PCB. Through this process, we recreate the schematic, unravel the function of each component, and, if possible, replicate the circuit for testing purpose.

                <h3>Reengineering Avionics: Rear Cockpit Monitor (RCM) for Hawk 100 Aircraft</h3>
                <img src="picture/hudmon_1.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" style="width:600px;height:300px;">
                <p>
                    The Rear Cockpit Monitor (RCM) on the Hawk 100 aircraft plays a crucial role as a co- pilot aid, enhancing situational awareness during flights. Serving as a Head-Up Display Monitor (HUDMON), the RCM displays video data from the aircraft's camera (CAM) and Head-Up Display (HUD) symbology.

                <p>
                    The RCM enables the co-pilot in the rear cockpit to easily monitor critical flight information, including real-time video data and HUD symbology. Its integration into the Hawk 100 cockpit design reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and pilot coordination. The RCM plays a key role in improving situational awareness during flights, ensuring quick and efficient access to essential information for the co-pilot.
