                    In 2024, I haven't been involved in many projects yet, except from work or my hobby in robotics. I'm planning to build my career in Japan, so I've been spending a lot of time deepening my fundamental knowledge in electronics, robotics, as well as English and Japanese languages for my future career prospects.

                    <h3>Implementing Model Predictive Control (MPC) on Ackermann Drive Robot for Autonomous Vehicle Simulation on ROS Gazebo</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've tried implementing Model Predictive Control (MPC) on a simulated Ackermann drive robot described in URDF (Universal Robot Description Format). This allows the robot to predict future states and adjust its path accordingly. Utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS), the robot navigates through dynamic environments using Gazebo for 3D simulation and RViz for visualization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The robot relies on a Lidar sensor to understand its surroundings, spotting obstacles and other simulation-vehicles . It also uses odometry through dead reckoning to know its exact location amidst the chaos.

                        Through this project, I aim to show that autonomous navigation in dynamic environments is achievable, obviously with keen perception, smart planning, and accurate modeling, I'm paving the way for a future where autonomous vehicles can navigate the world around them effortlessly.

            <h3>2023</h3>
            <p>
                This year, I spend the most of time to learn about electronics circuit in avionics application. Because, at this time I am working as electronics development engineer in one of defense industry in indonesia (PT. Infoglobal Teknologi Semesta) that heavily involved with military standard circuit and FPGA as the main controller.

                    <h3>Reverse Engineering Command and Weapon-Control Console (CWCC) of CAKRA-401 Submarine</h3>
                    <p>
                        KRI Cakra, a submarine of the 209/1300 type, was manufactured by Howaldtswerke in Kiel, Germany, in 1981. This type of submarine is widely utilized by navies around the world. The difficulty in sourcing spare parts for repairs poses a significant challenge. Therefore, it becomes essential to consider modernizing the submarine system.
                    </p>
                    <img src="picture/cakra_1.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" style="width:600px;height:300px;">
                    <p>
                        Reverse engineering an old device with fully analog signals need to understanding its inner workings. documentation plays a crucial role in the reverse engineering process, especially for an old device with fully analog signals. Any documentation or technical specifications related to the device can provide valuable insights for us. We also utilizing tools like oscilloscopes to analyze signal characteristics, identifying electronic components, and tracing circuit paths on the PCB. Through this process, we recreate the schematic, unravel the function of each component, and, if possible, replicate the circuit for testing purpose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The struggle of this project is, this submarine was built in 80’s in germany, it is using analog video signal that does not follow analog video standard at that time like PAL or NTSC. So I need to use flexible Video ADC chip as signal processing and find the best settings for the signals by analyzing the signal characteristics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The result is looks like the same as the old one but with newer technology like FPGA, replacing CRT with LCD display, make it lighter, save a lot of space, simple and more reliable.

                        The Rear Cockpit Monitor (RCM) on the Hawk 100 aircraft plays a crucial role as a co- pilot aid, enhancing situational awareness during flights. Serving as a Head-Up Display Monitor (HUDMON), the RCM displays video data from the aircraft's camera (CAM) and Head-Up Display (HUD) symbology.

                    <h3>Sound recognition using CNN in microcontroller for broken motor detection</h3>
                    <p>
                        Neural network training process requires high computing hardware. Thus, it is trained on a generic TensorFlow model. Moreover, training is only necessary if the customized dataset is suitable for deep learning models, as the application can also use pre-trained framework models. The dataset will be trained by TensorFlow and generate a model, but this model cannot be applied to the microcontroller yet. Because of this, the model is converted using TensorFlow Lite so that it can be applied to the microcontroller.

                        The model doesn't take in raw audio sample data, instead it works with spectrograms which are two dimensional arrays that are made up of slices of frequency information, each taken from a different time window. The recipe for creating the spectrogram data is that each frequency slice is created by running an FFT across a 30ms window of the audio sample data.

The Humanoid Robot can be said to be in a balanced position if the position of the Ground Projection Center of Mass (GCoM) is in the polygon support area. The support polygon got by calculating the convex hull using Jarvis March method. This project involved a lot basic of linear algebra, the exciting part for me when apply math in form of programming language and find the most effective way to do it. I was using recursive style that proposed by Mr. shuuji kajita in his book “Introduction to Humanoid Robot”. The humanoid robot designed in this project has a height of ±590 mm and a weight of ±4.9 kg.

                        I am working on the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) source code that utilizes the main microcontroller from Texas Instruments, specifically the Hercules series. I am configuring the I/O using the HalCoGen application and programming the state machine and interlock in the C language using Code Composer Studio (CCS). The communication between components is done using the CAN bus protocol. I also need to ensure the quality of the signals generated by the circuit before coding, and perform troubleshooting or add features if errors arise.

                        During the VCU program design phase, it would be highly risky to directly experiment with the algorithm on the electric bus directly. Therefore, a VCU test jig is necessary as a tool to simulate all components connected directly to the VCU, such as the gas pedal, key switch, and so on.
